        <h1>From Humble Begginings</h1>
        <p> The RR Engine was made with one dream. To be able to program animatronic shows.
         But it turned into something much more. It turned itno a community. It turned
         into hope, but it was stopped from corporate greed of a big company. Fun fact: The
         RR Engine didn't start as a CEC Simulator, it was a Rockafire Explosion simulator, 
         Rockafire Replay. Replay was thriving for a while, even Aaron Fecter, the creator
         of the Rockafire Explosion, liked it at one point. But even though he liked it, the
         game still ended its public life because of him and his legal threats. After that, 
         the game continued development in a private state until version 1.28. After that, the
         Rockafire chapter of the engine seemed closed. But one developer would come up and 
         try to continue the legacy of Rockafire Replay. One that many people know or hate. <p>
