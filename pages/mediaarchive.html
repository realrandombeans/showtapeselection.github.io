        <h1>Unusual Prototype 3 Stage</h1>
        <p>
            Origins: Unknown<br />
            Description: A picture of Centre Stage with all prop characters, excluding the Singing Flowers. The character cosmetics are quite different,
            with Munch Jr missing his hat, Building and Moon both having light blue cosmetics, and the building props are substantially different.
            Not to mention the sign does not feature a green outline, and both Munch Jr's can and Jasper's can are upside down. Jasper also features an
            unusual guitar color. This stage is incredibly odd.<br />
            Year: Early 90s(?), judging by Helen's mask.<br />
            Location: 3-Stage, Unknown <br />

        <h1>Cyberamic Singing Flower Ripped Mask</h1>
        <p>
            Origins: Unknown<br />
            Description: Believed to be a Cyberamic Singing Flower mask, judging by the eyes and mask. Unsure where this is from or why it is ripped off.<br />
            Year: Unknown, possibly early 2000s/early 1990s(?)<br />
            Location: Unknown, perhaps Corporate?<br />

            Origins: Smile America 80s Commercial<br />
            Description: Featured in the Smile America commercial, Pasqually and Munch have swapped places. It could be the Showboat stage, but would not make sense, as the camera would have the balcony stage on the left, not the right. <br />

            Description: The Band Board is a animatronic shelf of instruments which would play along with songs. Not much audio is left of it, and there is no video of it operating yet. A certain PTT promo includes some spotlights shining on the bass/snare drums very faintly (https://youtu.be/MYIUxp9TTuw?t=100). Not much is known if they had spotlights or not.<br />
