        <h1>Unusual Prototype 3 Stage</h1>
        <p>
            Origins: Unknown<br />
            Description: A picture of Centre Stage with all prop characters, excluding the Singing Flowers. The character cosmetics are quite different,
            with Munch Jr missing his hat, Building and Moon both having light blue cosmetics, and the building props are substantially different.
            Not to mention the sign does not feature a green outline, and both Munch Jr's can and Jasper's can are upside down. Jasper also features an
            unusual guitar color. This stage is incredibly odd.<br />
            Year: Early 90s(?), judging by Helen's mask.<br />
            Location: 3 Stage, Unknown <br />

            Year: Unknown, possibly early 2000s/early 1990s(?)<br />
            Location: Unknown, perhaps Corporate?<br />
