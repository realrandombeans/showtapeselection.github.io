        <h1>From Humble Beginnings</h1>
        <p> The RR Engine was made with one dream. To be able to program animatronic shows.
         But it turned into something much more. It turned into a community. It turned
         into hope, but it was stopped by corporate greed of a big company. The RR 
         Engine didn't start as a CEC Simulator, it was a Rockafire Explosion simulator, 
         Rockafire Replay. Replay was thriving for a while, even Aaron Fecter, the creator
         of the Rockafire Explosion, liked it at one point. But even though he liked it, the
         game still ended its public life because of him and his legal threats. After that, 
         the game continued development in a private state until version 1.28. After that, the
         Rockafire chapter of the engine seemed closed. But one developer would come up and 
         try to continue the legacy of Rockafire Replay with one game that many people like, or hate. <p>
        
        <h1>A New Hope</h1>
        <p>Retromation, formerly known as Roclafire Remake, was a continuation project of Rockafire
        Replay started by Galla, a well-known member of the CEC community. Fun fact: There actually 
        was a public build of the game released, but the animatronics didnt work and weren't programmable.    
        Retromation has been famous for how many times it has been leaked. Almost every major build has 
        been leaked, but the latest ones haven't. Probably the last build that was leaked was the build 
        with the new Beach Bear mask. Retromation was pretty close to coming into fruition, even trying to
        get deals with Aaron Fector made. But sadly, due to those deals not being successful, and mounting
        pressure from The 64th Gamer to cancel it due to it using his engine and assests, the game never got
        a true public release, though many of those old leaked builds are still up. The most famous one being
        1.26.1, which was the most accessible of them all, since the graphic settings actually worked, and it
        ran smoothly unlike 1.27.1. And that closes the chapter of the Rockafire Explosion part of this 
        engine. But a new announcement from 64th himself about a new animatronic simulator called "Reel To Real"
        being based on the Chuck E. Cheese cast of animatronics, brings new excitement and hype into the 
        situation, as people waited patiently for more information on this game. Retromation is still in 
        development today, but is almost completely private, with little builds being given out to anyone.<p>
